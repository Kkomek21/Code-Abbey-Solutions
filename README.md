# Code-Abbey-Solutions
My solutions to Code Abbey problems, done purely for educating myself.

I hope to solve all problems from the Code Abbey site, currently only using Python.

All problems are numbered, and their original title is pasted(whitespaces converted to underscores because it messes with git).

I try to comment everything; if the code is complicated enough to justify doing so.

Please do not use my code to grind for the certificate.
